# Iphone-Photo-Viewer-Project
This was the final project to my Special Topics class in school using Swift.
This application grabs photos from a couple different categories given by the teacher.
The app allows users to choose which photos are seen by activating one or more categories.
When a photo is tapped, it brings the photo up to full screen and has all functionality of zooming and panning.
Users can go back and choose another photo or change what categories are seen.
